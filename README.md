</div>

Stakeforge is my on-going new engine project, it's successor to [Lina Engine](https://github.com/inanevin/LinaEngine).

This time I'm focusing on developing extremely-fast, performance oriented engine framework, that tries to generalize/abstract less functionality than before. Idea is:

-  non-existing or minimal/simplistic editor, as custom editor development in Lina has been my biggest time consumer.
- less platform support -> less time spent on maintainence, ditching Vulkan and Metal support and effectively MacOS (at least until stuff is more feature-complete).
- production friendly workflow, fast shader & gltf pipelines.
- project oriented, no custom build systems and project management tools, no scripting and C++ hot-reloading attempts. idea is simply copy&paste engine code and implement the game.
- <b>performance</b>: data-oriented design, little to no runtime dynamic memory allocations. minimal abstractions & focus on data design, memory layout and cache utilization.

## At the moment we have:

- ok first of all a lot of stuff is missing, couple compremises here and there that will be fixed, but;
- DoD entity & component system, supporting all the basics.
- DoD resource management, aimed at no-hastle hot-reloading and simplicity.
- basic components, audio, physics, lights etc.
- Jolt physics integration.
- Miniaudio based simple audio system.
- proper game loop, variant delta based or fixed-timesteps with interpolation, along with Tracy profiler integration and custom in-engine frame-time tracking and memory tracking.
- very fast animation graph supporting state machines, transitions, 1D/2D blending, joint masking etc.
- bunch of platform, io, serialization, input, memory and other pipelinining utilities.
- pretty cute PBR renderer running on DX12 on windows;
	- Runs a deferred pipeline using prepass depth.
	- Supports full GLTF PBR workflow.
	- Point, spot and directional lights.
	- Traditional shadows for point and spots, cascaded shadow maps for directional lights.
	- Physically-correct bloom running on compute.
	- Half-res HBAO and upsampling in compute shaders.
	- Basics for Post-FX pipeline.
	- GUI & canvas rendering for game-world.
- DoD vector-graphics & widget system integrated into the engine.
- very cute retro-aesthetics debug console.

## Misc

stuff is constantly under development, I am seeing what's needed on the way, but idea is to put an open-source game(s) out there as soon as possible before making big plans :) Please do hit up the discussions and issues! and note that there are still some stuff in the engine that "defies" the premise of the engine, the foundation is not complete yet, but getting there gracefully!

### building/project

CMake based build system, tested on variety of MSVC versions, using C++23 features, should be straightforward on Windows. Can be made to run on Clang easily with couple of tweaks. only Win32 platform backend for now, rendering requires DX12 support with Shader Model 6.6 and above.
